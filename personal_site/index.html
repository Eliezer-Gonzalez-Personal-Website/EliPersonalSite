          <p class="bio-text">
            After working in the legal services industry for over 10 years, 
            I decided to go back to school to get my Bachelorâ€™s degree. 
            I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with a degree in 
            Information Technology and Systems (BS) in May 2015. I enjoy applying 
            information technology to business problems in order to find a solution. 
            Currently, I am looking for a job in the Information Technology field where 
            I can learn and grow. I invite you to look through my academic, professional 
            and community work. I hope you enjoy browsing through my website which I 
            designed using the Bootstrap Framework and published using Microsoft Azure.
